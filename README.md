CosrinDateCalculator
====================

Simple "out of character" date calculator written in PHP, for specific "in character" dates for the Multi-user dungeon, Cosrin: A New Dawn.

# EXECUTION
This should run on any basic web server which serves php4 or php5 pages.

# LIMITATIONS/BUGS
This was not updated for the latest Cosrin: A New Dawn months or any other game time modifications introduced since Cosrin: A New Dawn's release. This should work fine for calculating vanilla Legends of Cosrin dates.

Feel free to update and send a merge request!
